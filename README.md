## To run

First run `extract_files.py` to extract the files from the game, then run `generate_data.py` to generate a `still_alive.dat`. `still_alive.dat` can be read with the `still_alive_data_reader` module.

If `extract_files.py` runs into a file not found error, then provide it with the path to your Portal installation's `portal` folder as an argument.
